Preview of Summer 2015 Healthy Ride Pgh Data

This is a new project, currently just for fun.  

Possible Goals/Opportunities for Collaboration:  
-Descriptive Analysis and Exploration: Understand how bikes are currently being used  
-Predict the # of bikes at each station an hour in advance, based on current info, time of day, day of week, weather, etc...The idea is that healthy ride could use this to alleviate the 'balancing' problem  
-Mapping?  
-...?  

Immediate Next Steps:  
1.  Separate out date and time into 2 distinct columns that are the appropriate data types   
2.  Finish Feeling out Variable Inconsistencies/connections
3.  Univariate Distributions
