Preview of Summer 2015 Healthy Ride Pgh Data

This is a new project, currently just for fun.  

Possible Goals/Opportunities for Collaboration:  
-Descriptive Analysis and Exploration: Understand how bikes are currently being used  
-Predict the # of bikes at each station an hour in advance, based on current info, time of day, day of week, weather, etc...The idea is that healthy ride could use this to alleviate the 'balancing' problem  
-Mapping?  
-...?  

Current Todo:  
1.  Separate out date and time into 2 seperate columns that are the appropriate data types   
2.  Univariate Exploration/Feeling out Distros and Variable Inconsistencies
