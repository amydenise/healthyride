THE DATA

We will post a .zip folder for download each quarter with two files. Each trip is anonymous. All trips will be reported. Records with missing data values are the result of system maintenance, or trip returns recognized outside normal electronic channels.

The Rentals file includes:

Trip ID
Bike ID
Trip start day and time
Trip end day and time
Trip start station name and station ID
Trip end station name and station ID
Rider type: Member (pay as-you-go customer); Subscriber ( deluxe and standard monthly member customer); Daily (24-hour pass customer).
The Stations file can be easily imported in many mapping applications and includes:

Station ID and Station name
Lat/Long coordinates
Number of individual docking points at each station
